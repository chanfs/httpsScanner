httpsScanner Release Notes

v1.2
Removed error messages from being displayed when a SSL handshake failed. SSL handshakes failures are common for a tool like this as it is supposed to try to initiate a SSL connection using as many ciphersuites as possible and most web server do not enabled all ciphersuites.

The reporting at the end of the scan is modified to be more concise.
